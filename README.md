# Buck Euchre - Multiplayer Card Game

A real-time, multiplayer implementation of Buck Euchre, a 4-player trick-taking card game. Built with React, Node.js, and WebSockets.

## 🎮 About Buck Euchre

Buck Euchre is a variation of the classic Euchre card game played by 4 players individually (no partnerships). Players bid to win tricks, with a unique "countdown" scoring system where you race from 15 points to 0 or below to win.

For complete game rules, see [BUCK_EUCHRE_RULES.md](./BUCK_EUCHRE_RULES.md).

## 📋 Project Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation (MVP)  
**Task 1.1:** ✅ Complete - Project Structure Setup  
**Next Task:** 1.2 - Shared Types Module

See [AI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./AI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for detailed progress tracking.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This is a monorepo with three workspaces:

- **`shared/`** - Shared TypeScript types, constants, and validators
- **`backend/`** - Node.js/Express server with Socket.io for real-time gameplay
- **`frontend/`** - React/Vite web application

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** for UI components
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Socket.io-client** for real-time updates

### Backend
- **Node.js 20+** with TypeScript
- **Express** for REST API
- **Socket.io** for WebSocket connections
- **Prisma** ORM for database
- **PostgreSQL 16** for data persistence
- **Zod** for validation
- **JWT** for authentication

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ LTS
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- PostgreSQL 16 (or Docker)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd buck-euchre
```

2. **Install dependencies for all workspaces:**
```bash
# Install shared package
cd shared
npm install

# Install backend
cd ../backend
npm install

# Install frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
# Copy example environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# Edit backend/.env with your database credentials
# Edit frontend/.env with your API URLs
```

4. **Set up database:**
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

## 🎯 Development

### Running the Development Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Server runs on http://localhost:3000

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
App runs on http://localhost:5173

### Building for Production

**Build all workspaces:**
```bash
# Build shared package
cd shared
npm run build

# Build backend
cd ../backend
npm run build

# Build frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run build
```

## 🧪 Testing

**Backend unit tests:**
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

**Backend test watch mode:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run test:watch
```

- ⬜ Phase 2: Game logic (pure functions, fully tested)
- ⬜ Phase 3: Backend services
- ⬜ Phase 4: REST & WebSocket API
- ⬜ Phase 5: Frontend UI components

### Phase 6-8: Production Polish - ~2 weeks

**Total:** 53 tasks across 9 phases

## 🎮 How to Play

Once the MVP is complete:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Enter your name to join a session
3. Create or join a game (4 players required)
4. Once 4 players join, the game begins!
5. Place bids, declare trump, fold or stay, play cards, and race to 0!

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is being built incrementally following the AI Implementation Roadmap. Each task has specific acceptance criteria and testing requirements.

To contribute:
