# Branch Restructure Notes

## Summary
- Created a `post-54` branch that contains all commits after `Merge pull request #54`.
- Reset the `work` branch (main branch for this repository) to end at commit `3050467` corresponding to that merge.

## Purpose
Keeping the main branch aligned with the state of the repository at PR #54 simplifies comparisons for the next phase of work while preserving the later commits on their own branch for future reference.
